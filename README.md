# Chicago-Traffic-Analysis-Uncovering-Trends-for-CTA-Strategy
#Project Overview:
This repository hosts a comprehensive analysis of traffic crashes in Chicago, spanning a decade from 2013 to 2023. The project aims to identify patterns, types, and causes of traffic accidents to provide actionable insights for the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA). By leveraging a robust dataset from the City of Chicago's data portal, this analysis uncovers temporal and spatial trends in crash occurrences, categorizes crash types, and evaluates the impact of various factors like weather, lighting, and traffic controls on crash severity.

#Key Highlights:

Detailed exploratory data analysis to understand when and where crashes are most likely.
Investigation into the most common types of crashes and their underlying conditions.
Strategic recommendations for CTA management to mitigate crash occurrences and enhance commuter safety.
Findings & Recommendations:
Our findings include patterns indicating higher risks during specific times and locations, prevalent crash types, and the significant role of trafficway type on crash severity. Recommendations for CTA include enhancing traffic control measures, revising parking regulations, improving public education on road safety, and reevaluating road and intersection designs.
